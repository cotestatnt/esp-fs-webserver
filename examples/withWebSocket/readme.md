## esp-fs-webserver
This example is a little bit more advanced respect to the [simpleServer](https://github.com/cotestatnt/esp-fs-webserver/tree/main/examples/simpleServer) example.

Basically is the same HTML code like simpleServer, but with the adddition of a **WebSocket client** inside the webpage.

Off course, on the ESP MCU we will run also a **WebSocket server** togheter to the web server.
I've used the library [arduinoWebSockets](https://github.com/Links2004/arduinoWebSockets), so it is needed to compile, but you can choice wich you prefer.

With the help of WebSocket technology, we can send message from server-to-clients or from client-to-server in a **full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.**

In this very simple example is used only to push from ESP side a message (the NTP updated ESP system time) to the connected clients, just to show hot to setup a system like this.
